# Unit Economics Framework

## What Is Unit Economics?

Unit economics measures the direct revenues and costs associated with a single "unit" of your business—usually one customer or one transaction. If your unit economics don't work, scaling just means losing money faster.

**The core question:** Do you make money on each customer?

## Key Metrics

### For Subscription/SaaS Businesses

#### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
The total cost to acquire one new customer.

```
CAC = Total Sales & Marketing Spend ÷ Number of New Customers Acquired
```

**What to include:**
- Advertising spend
- Sales team salaries and commissions
- Marketing team salaries
- Software and tools for sales/marketing
- Content creation costs

**What NOT to include:**
- Product development costs
- General overhead

#### Lifetime Value (LTV)
The total revenue a customer generates over their entire relationship with you.

```
LTV = Average Revenue Per Customer × Average Customer Lifespan
```

Or more precisely:
```
LTV = (ARPU × Gross Margin) × Average Customer Lifespan
```

#### LTV:CAC Ratio
The relationship between customer value and acquisition cost.

```
LTV:CAC = Lifetime Value ÷ Customer Acquisition Cost
```

**Benchmarks:**
- < 1:1 = You're losing money on every customer (critical)
- 1:1 - 3:1 = Concerning; hard to build a sustainable business
- 3:1 - 5:1 = Healthy; room for growth
- > 5:1 = Excellent; consider investing more in growth

#### Payback Period
How many months until a customer's revenue covers their acquisition cost.

```
Payback Period = CAC ÷ Monthly Revenue Per Customer
```

**Benchmarks:**
- < 6 months = Excellent
- 6-12 months = Good
- 12-18 months = Acceptable (need capital to grow)
- > 18 months = Concerning (requires significant capital)

### For Transactional/E-commerce Businesses

#### Gross Margin Per Transaction
```
Gross Margin = (Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) ÷ Revenue
```

#### Contribution Margin
```
Contribution Margin = Revenue - Variable Costs
```

Variable costs include:
- COGS
- Transaction fees (payment processing)
- Shipping/fulfillment costs
- Variable customer support

#### Break-even Volume
```
Break-even Units = Fixed Costs ÷ Contribution Margin Per Unit
```

## Red Flags to Watch

### 1. "We'll Make It Up in Volume"
If you lose money on each transaction, selling more makes it worse. This only works if:
- You have genuine economies of scale coming
- You can prove exactly when/how costs decrease

### 2. Assuming CAC Will Decrease Over Time
Reality: CAC often *increases* as you:
- Exhaust easy channels
- Compete for the same customers
- Move beyond early adopters
- Scale past word-of-mouth

### 3. Ignoring Churn in LTV Calculations
If 50% of customers cancel after month 3, your LTV isn't "Monthly Revenue × 36 months."

### 4. Using Gross Revenue Instead of Net Revenue
Revenue after refunds, chargebacks, and discounts is what matters.

### 5. Hiding Costs
If you're not counting founder salaries, or excluding certain marketing costs, your CAC isn't real.

## Questions to Ask Yourself

1. **What does it cost to acquire ONE customer through EACH channel?**
   - Paid ads?
   - Content marketing?
   - Sales team?
   - Referrals?

2. **How much does ONE customer pay you over their lifetime?**
   - What's the average order value?
   - How often do they purchase?
   - How long do they stay?

3. **What are ALL the costs to serve ONE customer?**
   - Product/service delivery
   - Support
   - Infrastructure

4. **At what volume do you break even on monthly fixed costs?**

5. **Do these numbers get better or worse at scale?**
   - What drives economies of scale?
   - What gets more expensive?

## How to Improve Unit Economics

### Lower CAC
- Focus on channels with lowest CAC
- Improve conversion rates (same spend, more customers)
- Build referral/word-of-mouth engines
- Increase brand awareness (reduces CAC over time)

### Increase LTV
- Raise prices (if value supports it)
- Reduce churn (retention > acquisition)
- Upsell and cross-sell
- Improve product (increases usage, reduces churn)

### Improve Margins
- Negotiate with suppliers
- Reduce variable costs through automation
- Increase prices
- Optimize operations

## Unit Economics by Business Model

| Model | Key Unit | Critical Metrics |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| SaaS | Customer | LTV, CAC, Churn, ARPU |
| E-commerce | Order | AOV, Margin, CAC, Repeat Rate |
| Marketplace | Transaction | Take Rate, CAC (both sides), Liquidity |
| Service | Project/Engagement | Hourly Rate, Utilization, Project Margin |
| Consumer App | User | DAU, Monetization Rate, CAC |

## Using Unit Economics in Fundraising

Investors look for:
1. **Understanding:** Do you know your numbers cold?
2. **Trajectory:** Are they improving?
3. **Path to Health:** If not profitable yet, when/how will you be?
4. **Comparables:** How do you compare to others in your space?

**Weak answer:** "We're focused on growth right now, we'll figure out unit economics later."

**Strong answer:** "Our CAC is $50, LTV is $180 with a 3.6:1 ratio. We're working to reduce CAC to $35 by improving our conversion funnel, which would push us above 5:1."

## Tools for Calculation

### Basic Spreadsheet
For most early-stage startups, a simple spreadsheet works:
- Track all marketing spend by channel
- Track new customers by channel
- Calculate CAC by channel
- Monitor customer retention monthly
- Calculate running LTV as you gather data

### Key Principle
It's better to have rough but honest numbers than precise but fictional ones. Start tracking early, even if the data is imperfect.
