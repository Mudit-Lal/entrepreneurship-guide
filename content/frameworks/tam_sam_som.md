# TAM SAM SOM: Market Sizing Framework

## Overview

TAM SAM SOM is a framework for estimating market opportunity at three levels. It helps you understand the potential size of your business and communicate that to investors.

```
TAM (Total Addressable Market)
 └── SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)
      └── SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)
```

---

## Definitions

### TAM (Total Addressable Market)
The total market demand for your product/service if you had 100% market share and no constraints.

**Question:** If everyone who could buy your product did, how big is that market?

### SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)
The portion of TAM that you can realistically target given your:
- Geographic focus
- Customer segment focus
- Product capabilities
- Distribution channels

**Question:** Of the total market, which customers can you actually reach and serve?

### SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)
The portion of SAM you can realistically capture in a defined timeframe (usually 3-5 years), given:
- Competition
- Your resources
- Realistic growth assumptions

**Question:** What market share can you actually win?

## Example: Campus Food Delivery App

### TAM
All food delivery in the United States
- ~$150 billion annually

### SAM
Food delivery at US universities
- ~400 universities × average campus spending
- ~$5 billion annually

### SOM
Market share at target universities in 3 years
- Focus on 20 campuses
- Capture 15% of campus food delivery
- ~$45 million annually

## Calculation Methods

### Top-Down Approach
Start with large market data and narrow down.

1. Find industry market size (from research reports, IBISWorld, Statista)
2. Apply filters for your segment
3. Apply realistic market share assumption

**Pros:** Uses credible external data
**Cons:** Can feel arbitrary; may not reflect your actual opportunity

### Bottom-Up Approach
Build up from your unit economics.

1. Define your target customer
2. Estimate number of potential customers
3. Multiply by what each customer would pay

**Example:**
- 1,000 small businesses in Phoenix that need our service
- Average contract value: $5,000/year
- Bottom-up SAM: $5 million

**Pros:** Grounded in your actual business
**Cons:** May underestimate opportunity

### Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
Use both methods and reconcile.

1. Calculate top-down for credibility
2. Calculate bottom-up for grounding
3. Explain the difference
4. Use the more conservative number

## Common Mistakes

### 1. TAM Fantasy
Using an absurdly large TAM to impress.

**Bad:** "The global health and wellness market is $4.5 trillion"
**Better:** "The US corporate wellness software market is $2 billion"

### 2. Unrealistic SOM
Claiming you'll capture 10%+ of a market quickly.

**Reality check:** In most markets, startups take years to reach 1% market share.

### 3. Missing the Filter Logic
Not explaining *why* you're focusing on a particular segment.

### 4. Static Analysis
Markets change. Your analysis should consider:
- Market growth rate
- Disruption potential
- Emerging segments

### 5. Ignoring Competition
SOM must account for competitors who want the same customers.

## What Investors Look For

### 1. Logic and Defensibility
Can you walk through your assumptions step by step?

### 2. Appropriate SOM
- Too small: "Is this worth the effort?"
- Too large: "Are they delusional?"
- Just right: Large enough to be interesting, small enough to be achievable

### 3. Path to Growth
How does SOM grow over time? What unlocks larger SAM?

### 4. Honesty About Unknowns
Acknowledging uncertainty is more credible than false precision.

## Market Size by Business Stage

| Stage | Appropriate Focus | Evidence Needed |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Idea | TAM exists and is growing | Industry reports |
| Validation | SAM is defined and reachable | Customer interviews |
| MVP | SOM is achievable | Early traction data |
| Growth | SOM expanding, SAM in sight | Revenue and growth rates |

### Slide Structure
```
MARKET OPPORTUNITY

TAM: $X billion
[Brief explanation of what this includes]

## Practical Exercise

### Step 1: Define Your Market
- What problem are you solving?
- Who has this problem?
- What do they currently pay for solutions?

### Step 2: Calculate TAM
- Find total market size from 2-3 sources
- Triangulate for reasonableness

### Step 3: Define Your SAM
- What's your initial target segment?
- Why this segment first?
- What's the size of this segment?

### Step 4: Estimate Your SOM
- What market share is realistic in 3 years?
- How many customers is that?
- What revenue does that represent?

### Step 5: Stress Test
- What if you're wrong by 50%?
- Is it still worth pursuing?
- What are the biggest assumptions?

## Key Takeaway

Market sizing isn't about coming up with the biggest possible number—it's about demonstrating that you understand your market deeply and have a realistic plan to capture meaningful share.

**Credibility > Impressiveness**
