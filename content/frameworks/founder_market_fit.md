# Founder-Market Fit Framework

## Overview

Founder-Market Fit is the alignment between who you are and the problem you're solving. Investors and advisors look for it because founders with strong founder-market fit are more likely to:

- Persist through challenges
- Understand customers deeply
- Build the right solution
- Attract the right team
- Win against better-resourced competitors

## What Creates Founder-Market Fit

### 1. Deep Domain Expertise
You've worked in this industry and understand its nuances.

**Questions to ask:**
- Have you worked in this industry?
- Do you understand the workflows, terminology, and politics?
- Do you know where the bodies are buried?

**Example:** A former nurse building healthcare software knows which features actually matter in a clinical setting.

### 2. Personal Experience with the Problem
You've felt the pain yourself.

**Questions to ask:**
- Have you personally experienced this problem?
- How long did you struggle with it?
- What did you try before building a solution?

**Example:** A founder who struggled with anxiety building a mental health app understands the user journey intimately.

### 3. Unique Insight or Access
You know something others don't, or can reach customers others can't.

**Questions to ask:**
- What do you understand that competitors don't?
- Why do you see this opportunity when others don't?
- Do you have relationships that give you an advantage?

**Example:** A former Uber driver building logistics software has insights into the real daily challenges.

### 4. Relevant Skills
Your skills match what the company needs to succeed.

**Questions to ask:**
- What skills does this business require?
- Which skills do you bring?
- Where are the gaps, and how will you fill them?

**Example:** A technical founder building a deep tech product vs. building a sales-heavy business.

### 5. Obsession and Calling
You can't imagine doing anything else.

**Questions to ask:**
- Why this problem, and why you?
- What makes you the person to solve this?
- Will you still be working on this in 10 years?

**Example:** A climate scientist who can't sleep at night about carbon emissions building climate tech.

## Assessing Your Own Founder-Market Fit

### Strong Fit Indicators
- You've been thinking about this problem for years
- You understand customer pain at a visceral level
- You have relationships in the industry
- You bring rare skills to the problem
- You get energized talking to customers
- You'd work on this even if it wasn't a startup

### Weak Fit Indicators
- You chose the market because it's "hot"
- You've never experienced the problem yourself
- You don't know anyone in the industry
- You find customer conversations draining
- You could see yourself pivoting to something else
- Your skills don't match the business needs

### Honest Questions to Ask Yourself

1. **Why this problem?**
   Not "it's a big market" but why do YOU care?

2. **Why now?**
   What has changed that makes this the right time?

3. **Why you?**
   What makes you more likely to solve this than others?

4. **What do you know that others don't?**
   Your unfair insight or advantage.

5. **Will you persist when it's hard?**
   Because it will be hard. For years.

## Building Founder-Market Fit

If your current fit is weak, you can strengthen it:

### Immersion
- Work in the industry (even briefly)
- Shadow potential customers
- Attend industry conferences
- Read everything about the space
- Join industry communities

### Experience
- Use competitor products extensively
- Experience the problem firsthand if possible
- Talk to 100+ potential customers

### Relationships
- Build a network in the industry
- Find advisors with domain expertise
- Recruit team members who have the expertise you lack

### Humility
- Partner with someone who has fit you lack
- Hire your weaknesses
- Listen more than you talk

---

## Founder-Market Fit in Team Context

### Complementary Fit
Not every founder needs to have deep domain expertise. A team can have:
- One founder with market expertise
- One founder with technical skills
- One founder with go-to-market experience

The important thing is that the *team* has fit, even if not every individual does.

### Red Flags in Teams
- No one on the team has industry experience
- Founders are building for a customer they've never met
- All skills are overlapping (three engineers, no one who talks to customers)
- Founders disagree on the problem or customer

---

## Investor Perspective on Founder-Market Fit

### What Investors Look For
1. **Authenticity:** Does the founder genuinely care about this problem?
2. **Expertise:** Do they understand the market deeply?
3. **Durability:** Will they persist for 7-10 years?
4. **Insight:** Do they see something non-obvious?

### How Investors Assess It
- Depth of answers about the market
- Stories that reveal genuine experience
- Quality of customer relationships
- Clarity on competitive landscape
- Specific examples, not generalities

### Questions Investors Ask
- "Why did you decide to work on this?"
- "Tell me about your experience with this problem."
- "What's something you know about this market that most people miss?"
- "Who was the first customer you talked to?"
- "What surprised you most in your customer research?"

---

## When to Pivot vs. Persist

### Reconsider the Market If:
- You dread customer conversations
- You don't care about the users you're building for
- You can't articulate why this market over others
- Your skills are completely wrong for the business
- Six months in, you still feel like an outsider

### Persist If:
- You care deeply about the problem
- You have unique insight
- Challenges are external (funding, product), not internal (motivation)
- Customers want what you're building
- You're learning and growing in the role

## Founder-Market Fit Assessment

Rate yourself 1-5 on each dimension:

| Dimension | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Domain expertise | | |
| Personal experience with problem | | |
| Unique insight/access | | |
| Relevant skills | | |
| Obsession/calling | | |
| Industry relationships | | |
| Customer empathy | | |

**Total score interpretation:**
- 28-35: Strong fit—lean into it
- 21-27: Moderate fit—address gaps intentionally
- 14-20: Developing fit—immerse yourself
- Below 14: Weak fit—consider pivoting or partnering

## Key Takeaway

Founder-market fit isn't about having a perfect resume for your market. It's about having the insight, obsession, and skills to persist and win in a specific domain.

**The best founders are those who simply cannot NOT work on their problem.**

If you're not sure whether you have fit, ask yourself: Would you still be working on this problem if there were no financial upside? If the answer is no, you might be chasing a market, not a calling.
