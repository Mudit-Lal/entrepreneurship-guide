# Competitive Analysis Framework

## Overview

Understanding your competition helps you position your product, identify opportunities, and avoid building something that already exists. Good competitive analysis goes beyond listing competitors—it reveals market dynamics and strategic opportunities.

## Types of Competitors

### Direct Competitors
Companies solving the same problem for the same customers with similar solutions.

**Example:** If you're building a project management tool, Asana and Monday.com are direct competitors.

### Indirect Competitors
Companies solving the same problem with different approaches.

**Example:** If you're building a project management tool, spreadsheets and email are indirect competitors.

### Substitutes
How customers currently solve the problem without any product.

**Example:** Not using any tool—just meetings and verbal communication.

### Potential Competitors
Companies that could easily enter your market.

**Example:** Large platforms that could add your feature (Google, Microsoft, Salesforce).

## Competitive Positioning Statement

Template:
```
For [target customer]
Who [statement of need]
Our [product/service]
Is a [category]
That [key benefit]
Unlike [primary competitor]
We [primary differentiation]
```

## Common Mistakes

### 1. "We Have No Competition"
You always have competition. If nothing else, the status quo (doing nothing) is your competitor.

**Better:** "Our primary competition is [X], but we differentiate by [Y]"

### 2. Dismissing Competitors
"They're too slow/big/dumb to compete."

Large companies can move fast when motivated. Respect your competition.

### 3. Feature Comparison Only
Features can be copied. Focus on sustainable advantages:
- Brand and trust
- Network effects
- Data and insights
- Relationships
- Speed of iteration

### 4. Static Analysis
Markets change. Update your competitive analysis quarterly.

### 5. Obsessing Over Competition
Spend 10% of your time on competitors, 90% on customers.
