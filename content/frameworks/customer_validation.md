# Customer Validation Framework

## Overview

Customer validation is the process of determining whether your target customers actually have the problem you think they have, and whether they'll pay for your solution. It's the difference between building what you think people want versus what they'll actually buy.

**Core principle:** Talk to customers before building, during building, and after building.

---

## The Validation Hierarchy

```
1. Problem Validation
   "Do people actually have this problem?"

2. Solution Validation
   "Does our solution address the problem?"

3. Willingness to Pay
   "Will they pay for it?"

4. Channel Validation
   "Can we reach them efficiently?"
```

Each level must be validated before investing heavily in the next.

## Problem Validation

### Goal
Confirm that your target customers experience the problem you're solving, that it matters enough to them to seek solutions, and that current alternatives are inadequate.

### Methods

#### Customer Interviews
The gold standard for problem validation.

**How many:** 20-50 interviews to start seeing patterns
**Format:** Open-ended, 30-60 minutes
**Goal:** Understanding, not selling

#### Key Questions
1. "Tell me about the last time you experienced [problem area]..."
2. "What did you do about it?"
3. "What solutions have you tried?"
4. "What's frustrating about current solutions?"
5. "How often does this come up?"
6. "What does it cost you (time, money, stress)?"

#### What to Listen For
- **Frequency:** Daily problem > annual problem
- **Intensity:** "It's annoying" vs. "It's killing us"
- **Current spending:** Already paying for alternatives = validated demand
- **Hair-on-fire:** Urgency and desperation

### Red Flags
- "That would be nice to have" (not must-have)
- Vague answers about frequency or impact
- No current workarounds (maybe not a real problem)
- "My friend has that problem" (talk to the friend)

### Green Flags
- Specific, detailed stories about the problem
- Current spending on inadequate solutions
- Emotional response when describing the problem
- Asking when your solution will be ready

## Interview Best Practices

### The Mom Test
From Rob Fitzpatrick's book of the same name.

**Rules:**
1. Talk about their life, not your idea
2. Ask about specifics in the past, not generics or opinions about the future
3. Talk less, listen more

**Bad questions:**
- "Do you think this is a good idea?" (They'll say yes to be nice)
- "Would you buy this?" (Hypothetical, unreliable)
- "How much would you pay?" (They'll make up a number)

**Good questions:**
- "What do you currently do about [problem]?"
- "Tell me about the last time that happened..."
- "Why haven't you fixed this already?"

### Interview Flow

```
1. Introduction (2 min)
   - Thank them for their time
   - Explain you're researching [problem area]
   - Ask permission to take notes

2. Context (5 min)
   - Learn about their role/situation
   - Understand their world

3. Problem Exploration (20 min)
   - "Tell me about..."
   - "What happened next?"
   - "Why is that?"
   - Go deep on specific instances

4. Current Solutions (10 min)
   - What do they use now?
   - What do they like/dislike?
   - What have they tried?

5. Wrap-up (5 min)
   - "Anything else I should know?"
   - "Who else should I talk to?"
   - Thank them
```

### After the Interview
- Write up notes immediately
- Capture direct quotes
- Note surprises and patterns
- Update your assumptions

## Solution Validation

### Methods

#### Prototype Testing
- Paper prototypes
- Clickable mockups
- Wizard of Oz (fake it manually)
- Concierge MVP (do it by hand)

#### Landing Page Tests
- Describe the solution
- Include pricing
- Measure sign-ups or waitlist interest
- A/B test messaging

#### Pre-sales
- Sell before you build
- "Pay now, get access when ready"
- Crowdfunding campaigns
- Letters of intent from B2B customers

### What to Measure
- Do they understand the solution?
- Do they believe it solves their problem?
- What concerns do they have?
- What's missing?

---

## Willingness to Pay Validation

### Methods

#### Price Sensitivity Questions
1. "At what price would you consider this too expensive?"
2. "At what price would you consider this a bargain?"
3. "At what price would you think it's too cheap to be good?"

#### Commitment Testing
- "Would you pay $X for this?" = weak signal
- "Here's an invoice for $X" = strong signal
- "Here's a discount code valid for 48 hours" = time-pressured commitment

#### Anchoring
- Compare to what they currently spend
- Compare to the cost of not solving the problem
- "How much time does this problem cost you weekly?"

---

## Channel Validation

### Questions
- How do these customers currently find solutions?
- Where do they spend time (online and offline)?
- Who influences their purchasing decisions?
- What's the typical sales cycle?

### Methods
- Test different acquisition channels
- Measure CAC by channel
- Track conversion rates
- Talk to others who sell to this audience

## Validation Checklist

### Problem
- [ ] Interviewed 20+ potential customers
- [ ] Consistent problem description across interviews
- [ ] Problem causes real pain (time, money, frustration)
- [ ] Currently using inadequate alternatives
- [ ] Problem occurs frequently enough to warrant solution

### Solution
- [ ] Tested prototype with target customers
- [ ] Solution understood without lengthy explanation
- [ ] Addresses core problem identified in interviews
- [ ] Key objections identified and addressed
- [ ] Iteration based on feedback

### Willingness to Pay
- [ ] Tested pricing with real customers
- [ ] Received payment or concrete commitment
- [ ] Understand price sensitivity
- [ ] Price supports viable unit economics

### Channel
- [ ] Identified 2-3 potential acquisition channels
- [ ] Tested at least one channel
- [ ] Have data on customer acquisition cost
- [ ] Understand sales cycle length

## When to Stop Validating and Start Building

You have enough validation when:
- Clear, consistent problem articulation from customers
- Several customers actively asking for the solution
- At least one channel shows promise
- Willingness to pay has been tested (ideally with actual payment)

**Warning:** Validation can become procrastination. At some point, you need to build and sell.

---

## Common Validation Mistakes

### 1. Confirmation Bias
Hearing what you want to hear. Counter by:
- Actively seeking disconfirming evidence
- Asking "why wouldn't you use this?"
- Having a co-founder challenge your interpretations

### 2. Talking to the Wrong People
Friends and family are not your target customers. Find real prospects.

### 3. Leading Questions
"Don't you think this is a great idea?" will always get a yes.

### 4. Not Enough Interviews
5 interviews is a start, not a finish. Patterns emerge around 20-30.

### 5. Validating Features, Not Problems
Features come and go. Make sure the core problem is real first.

## Tools and Resources

- **Calendly/Cal.com:** Schedule interviews
- **Otter.ai/Grain:** Transcribe interviews
- **Notion/Airtable:** Organize findings
- **Typeform/Google Forms:** Quick surveys (supplement, not replace interviews)

## Key Takeaway

The goal of validation is not to prove your idea is good—it's to learn whether it's good, and to improve it based on reality. Be genuinely curious, not defensive.

**Great founders change their minds based on evidence.**
