## When to Engage SkySong

### You Should Contact SkySong If:

- Your research has produced a novel technology
- You want to patent an innovation
- You're considering starting a company based on ASU IP
- A company wants to license your technology

### You May Not Need SkySong If:
- Your venture doesn't involve ASU-developed IP
- You're building a service business
- Your innovation was developed entirely outside ASU
- You're using only publicly available technology

## The Technology Transfer Process

### Step 1: Disclosure
Submit an Invention Disclosure Form describing:
- What the invention is
- How it works
- Who contributed (all inventors)
- Funding sources used
- Any prior publications or public disclosures

### Step 2: Assessment
SkySong evaluates:
- Patentability (novel, non-obvious, useful)
- Market potential
- Development stage
- Competitive landscape
- Licensing vs. startup potential

### Step 3: Protection Decision
SkySong decides whether to:
- File a patent application
- Seek other protection
- Release rights to inventors

### Step 4: Commercialization
Options include:
- License to existing company
- Create a startup
- Further development with industry partner

## Starting a Company with ASU IP

### The Process
1. Disclose the invention
2. SkySong assesses startup potential
3. Negotiate exclusive license agreement
4. Form the company
5. Raise funding (often needed to pay license fees)

### Typical License Terms
- **Equity:** SkySong often takes 1-5% equity in startups
- **Upfront Fees:** Can range from $0 to $50,000+ depending on technology
- **Royalties:** Typically 1-5% of revenue
- **Milestones:** May include development and commercialization milestones

### What Founders Should Know
- The university retains ownership of IP developed using university resources
- Licensing is the mechanism by which startups access this IP
- Terms are negotiable within university policy
- SkySong has incentive to help startups succeed

## IP Considerations for Students

### General Rule
- IP developed as part of your job (RA, TA) may belong to ASU
- IP developed using significant university resources may belong to ASU
- IP developed on your own time, with your own resources, is typically yours

### Gray Areas
- Using university labs or equipment
- Building on faculty research
- Funded by university grants

**Recommendation:** If you're unsure, consult SkySong before developing or commercializing. Prevention is easier than dispute resolution.

## SBIR/STTR Support

SkySong provides significant support for federal Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) grants:

### Services Offered
- Proposal review and feedback
- Budget development assistance
- Commercialization strategy
- Connection to SBIR/STTR mentors
- Match funding for some programs

### Why This Matters
- Non-dilutive funding (grants, not equity)
- Validates technology for future investors
- Can be substantial ($50K - $1M+)
- ASU has strong track record

## Tips for Working with SkySong

1. **Disclose early:** Before publishing or presenting
2. **Document everything:** Lab notebooks, development timelines
3. **Be honest:** About other contributors, funding sources

6. **Understand the terms:** Get help reviewing license agreements

## Relationship to Other ASU Programs
