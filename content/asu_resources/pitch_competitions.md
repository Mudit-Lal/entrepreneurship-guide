## Pitch Preparation

### The 60-Second Pitch (Open Pitch Format)

```
Structure:
1. Hook (10 sec): Attention-grabbing problem statement
2. Problem (10 sec): Who has this problem, why it matters
3. Solution (15 sec): What you're building
4. Traction (10 sec): What you've done/learned
5. Ask (15 sec): What you need, what's next
```

**Tips:**
- Memorize it cold—no notes
- Practice with a timer
- Lead with the most compelling element
- End with energy

### The 5-Minute Pitch (Demo Day Format)

```
Structure:
1. Hook (30 sec): Compelling problem or story
2. Problem (45 sec): Deep understanding of pain point
3. Solution (60 sec): How you solve it
4. Market (30 sec): Size and opportunity
5. Traction (45 sec): What you've proven
6. Business Model (30 sec): How you make money
7. Team (30 sec): Why you're the ones to do this
8. Ask (30 sec): What you need, how you'll use it
```

**Tips:**
- One idea per slide
- Minimal text, maximum visuals
- Know your numbers cold
- Practice Q&A as much as pitch

### What Judges Look For

| Criteria | Weight | What It Means |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| Problem/Solution | High | Is this a real problem with a viable solution? |
| Market | Medium | Big enough to build a business? |
| Traction | High | Have you done more than talk? |
| Team | High | Can you execute? |
| Presentation | Medium | Clear, confident, compelling? |

### Common Mistakes

1. **Spending too long on solution:** Judges need to understand the problem first
2. **Fuzzy numbers:** "The market is huge" is not convincing
3. **No customer evidence:** "People would love this" vs. "We interviewed 50 customers..."
4. **Defensive in Q&A:** Judges are testing, not attacking
5. **Reading slides:** Know your material

## Q&A Strategies

### Framework for Answering
1. **Acknowledge** the question
2. **Answer** directly (don't dodge)
3. **Pivot** to a strength if possible

### When You Don't Know
- "We haven't tested that yet, but our hypothesis is..."
- "That's a great question—here's what we do know..."
- Never make up data

### Common Tough Questions
- "What happens if [big competitor] does this?"
- "Your market size seems aggressive—walk me through your assumptions"
- "Why haven't you gotten more traction?"
- "What's your plan B if [key assumption] doesn't hold?"

## After the Competition

### If You Win

- Use prize money strategically
- Leverage the credibility
- Follow up with interested judges/investors

### If You Don't Win
