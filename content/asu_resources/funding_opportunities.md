## Non-Dilutive Funding Tips

### What is Non-Dilutive Funding?
Money that doesn't require giving up equity in your company. Includes:
- Grants
- Competitions
- Revenue from customers (the best kind!)

### Why Prioritize Non-Dilutive Early?
1. Preserves ownership
2. Validates without investor pressure
3. No repayment required
4. Can make you more attractive to investors later

### Best Practices
- Apply to multiple opportunities simultaneously
- Budget time for applications (they take effort)
- Track deadlines in a calendar
- Ask for feedback on unsuccessful applications
- Build relationships with program administrators

## Bootstrapping as a Strategy

Not every business needs funding. Consider bootstrapping if:
- Your business can generate early revenue
- You can build an MVP with minimal capital
- You want to maintain full control
- Your market doesn't require massive scale to win

### Bootstrapping Resources at ASU
- Free mentorship through E+I
- Free prototyping in maker spaces
- Student labor (internships, class projects)
- University facilities and resources

## Important Considerations for International Students

If you're on an F-1 visa:
- You cannot receive payment for work (salaries) without proper authorization
- Prize money from competitions is generally permissible
- Grants may have restrictions—consult with OIS
- You can own a business but cannot work in it without CPT/OPT
- Consider Delaware C-Corp structure for investor readiness

**Always consult ASU's Office of International Students (OIS) before accepting any funding.**

2. **Identify appropriate funding:** Match your stage to funding sources
3. **Meet with E+I:** Get guidance on applications
4. **Apply strategically:** Don't spray and pray; focus on best fits
5. **Track and follow up:** Maintain relationships regardless of outcome
